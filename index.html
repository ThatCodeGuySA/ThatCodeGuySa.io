        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>
            As a driven University Student, I am deeply passionate about cybersecurity and its critical role in
            safeguarding digital infrastructure. With a solid background in Information Technology, particularly in
            Applications Development, I possess a comprehensive understanding of the complexities and challenges within
            the cybersecurity landscape. My coursework and practical experiences have honed my skills in identifying
            vulnerabilities, implementing effective security measures, and mitigating cyber threats. Through recent
            certifications in cybersecurity, including Junior Cybersecurity Analyst Career Path and Cyber Threat
            Management from Cisco, I have further expanded my expertise and readiness to tackle evolving cybersecurity
            challenges head-on. With a relentless commitment to continuous learning and staying updated with the latest
            industry trends, I am eager to leverage my skills and knowledge to contribute meaningfully to the protection
            of digital assets and data integrity.
